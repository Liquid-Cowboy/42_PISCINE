# PISCINE 🦾

[**The Piscine**](PISCINE) bootcamp is a 26 day intensive course intensive program that covers the basics of Shell and C programming. Students are expected to solve a series of foundational exercises while learning the fundamentals of Shell and integrating core C concepts: syntax, variables, pointers and memory management.

If the student manages to transition to the 42 common core, they're invited to take part in [**Piscine Reloaded**](PISCINE_RELOADED): a week long project that bridges the gap between what was learnt during the piscine and some useful knowledge to complete the first few common core projects.  
Here I've gathered my progress, along with some [exam preparation exercises](exam_preparation_exercises/PISCINE_exam) that helped me during the four weeks.
