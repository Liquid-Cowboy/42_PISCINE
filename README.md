# PISCINE

[**The Piscine**](https://github.com/Liquid-Cowboy/42_PISCINE/tree/main/PISCINE) bootcamp is a 26 day intensive course which covers the basics of Shell and C programming. The student is expected to learn some basic Shell commands and to grasp some notions about C syntax, variables, pointers and memory allocation.

## PISCINE RELOADED
If the student manages to transition to the 42 common core, he's invited to take part in [**Piscine Reloaded**](PISCINE_RELOADED) : a week long project that bridges the gap between what was learnt during the piscine and some useful knowledge to complete the first few common core projects.  
Here I've gathered my progress, along with some exam preparation exercises that helped me during the four weeks.
